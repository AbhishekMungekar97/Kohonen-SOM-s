## Kohonen's Self Organizing Maps
### - In this notebook, we will be generating a Kohonen Self Organizing Map for 24 randomly chosen colors.
### - We will be looking at 5 different cases, where the ability of the self organizing maps will be observed over varying ranges of "Initialized sigma" and "Epochs".
#### (*Note - Since the outputs take up a large chunk of space, only the code for the SOM's are being shown)
